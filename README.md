#Listening Room Add-Ons Website

##Installation
The website is written in JavaScript and run in Node.js. Instructions for installation of Node can be found at http://nodejs.org/.

This depends upon the following modules. You need to install these via npm (http://npmjs.org/). I installed them all locally rather than globally.

 * clutch (npm install clutch).
 * mysql (npm install mysql). Of course you'll also need to set up a mysql server and a database with a user and enter the right values in config.js.
 * request (npm install mysql).
